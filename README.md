# Diceroller

This is a 3d Dice made with CSS3. It uses several options to make it look like the real thing, and you can roll it too!

The rolling animation is made with @keyframes and classes, that are given with javascript, and the CSS is made with the SASS preprocessor.

2/6 update: Now you can roll indifinetly, and the page will keep track of the total result of each roll.

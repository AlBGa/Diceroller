# Diceroller

This is a 3d Dice made with CSS3. It uses several options to make it look like the real thing, and you can roll it too!

The rolling animation is made with @keyframes and classes, that are given with javascript, and the CSS is made with the SASS preprocessor.

Now it works with promises to roll ten dice in sequence.
